This sample illustrates how DexGuard can harden an application that uses the
APK Expansion Library for the Google Play market.

Before building and running the sample in downloader_sample, you should adapt
it for your own Google Play publisher account:

- src/com/example/expansion/downloader/SampleDownloaderService.java:
    BASE64_PUBLIC_KEY must specify the public key from your Google Play profile.
    SALT should define a random byte sequence.
- src/com/example/expansion/downloader/SampleDownloaderActivity.java
    xAPKS must specify your uploaded expansions.

The sample configuration dexguard-project.txt then shows how to apply additional
layers of obfuscation to the combined code of the application and the library.
